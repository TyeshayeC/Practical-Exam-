 First Step After creating your, Azure Portal account. You will then go to the top left corner and click on "Create a Resource" which will 
 then take you to the page where you see different options to exactly choose the specific, Resource you would like to create. In This Tutorial will show how to create A Vitural Machine.

Again, for this Specific Tutorial, we will be creating A Virutal Machine. Make sure to fill out all the areas that are marked with the astericks. So, once you get to this step
you'll then click on the drop down the choose the "resource group" that was created. In this case for us will be the "RG-LAB01" Shown in step 3

Here, In Step 5 you will fill out the boxes which is what creates the actual Virtual Machine. Choose the Resource Group, create a Virtual Machine name
choose the image youll be using (which here we used the Windows 10, Youll then create a password (its best to pull up note pad to save your username and password, if not you'll have to recreate the VM) Once you're done filling out everything click the "I CONFIRM" TAB if some people do forget which is ok, but it wil send a error message to go back afterwards click on NEXT:DISK to take you to Networking

So, For the networking section normally where you see the organge circle. the drop down will show the RG that we originally created (for mine its not populating)

STEP 6 after the networking section, you'll the review and create the virual machine, it'll show "validation passed" which lets you know the VM has been created.
